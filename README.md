# avr-assembler
This is a very simple implementation of a 2-pass assembler, implemented as part of the course project in CSC 113: Introduction to 
Embedded-Systems Design at Hofstra University. This assembler converts an AVR assembly language program (with some limitations)
into machine code.

The `test.java` contains the `main()` function. A sample assembly program is uploaded in `testAssembler.txt` to test the assembler. A GUI 
version will be implemented soon, where user can upload the input file to be assembled.
