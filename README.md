# csc113-assembler
This is a very simple implementation of a 2-pass assembler, implemented as part of the course project in CSC 113: Introduction to 
Embedded-Systems Design at Hofstra University. This assembler converts an AVR assembly language program into machine code (with some limitations).

The `test.java` contains the `main()` function. A sample assembly program can be found in `testAssembler.txt`. To test this assembler, download and compile all the files, and run `java Test`. A GUI version will be implemented soon, where user can upload the input file to be assembled.
